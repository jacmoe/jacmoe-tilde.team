I have now moved my site to tilde.team. And am now generating the HTML mirror using Gemtexter. Looking forward to be spending time with the community at tilde.team!

At the web I constantly have the feeling of posting into the void. Here, in the Smolnet, I know that I am. Should anyone happen to stumble upon this tinylog, it is going to be an unexpected bonus. And that is a consolation, and quite a bit liberating, I think!

Busy getting my bearings in this entirely new universe. Very exciting! And really digging that everything is pure, unadulterated text! 😁

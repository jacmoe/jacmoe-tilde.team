# Jacmoe's Cyber Soapbox
> Increasingly Interesting ...


## Welcome
Here you will find an eclectic mix of writing, philosophy, humor, programming, Linux living, and culture. I am a very autistic Danish-Norwegian creative writer - 🇳🇴🇩🇰

I have too many projects; too much time.

My primary reason for being here is to connect with fellow creative writers, nerdy Linux users, and neurokin.

I will also evangelize Emacs , promote the Zig programming language, share my interest in shorthand, rant about how awesome the colemak kb layout is, and other infodumps.

I am excited to be a part of the smol internet!

## Tinylog
Last three entries in my Tinylog:

I have now moved my site to tilde.team. And am now generating the HTML mirror using Gemtexter. Looking forward to be spending time with the community at tilde.team!

At the web I constantly have the feeling of posting into the void. Here, in the Smolnet, I know that I am. Should anyone happen to stumble upon this tinylog, it is going to be an unexpected bonus. And that is a consolation, and quite a bit liberating, I think!

Busy getting my bearings in this entirely new universe. Very exciting! And really digging that everything is pure, unadulterated text! 😁

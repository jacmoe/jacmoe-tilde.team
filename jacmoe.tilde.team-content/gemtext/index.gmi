## Welcome To Jacmoe's Cyber Soapbox
> Increasingly Interesting ...

Here you will find an eclectic mix of writing, philosophy, humor, programming, Linux living, and culture. I am a very autistic Danish-Norwegian creative writer - ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°

I have too many projects; too much time.

My primary reason for being here is to connect with fellow creative writers, nerdy Linux users, and neurokin.

I will also evangelize Emacs , promote the Zig programming language, share my interest in shorthand, rant about how awesome the colemak kb layout is, and other infodumps.

I am excited to be a part of the smol internet!
